 Then if a visitor sends a message (`MessageStream.send(message:isHintQuestion:)`), the chat changes it's state to `queue`. The chat can be turned into this state by calling `MessageStream.startChat()`.
 After that, if an operator takes the chat to process, the state changes to `chatting`. The chat is being in this state until the visitor or the operator closes it.
 When closing a chat by the visitor `MessageStream.closeChat()`, it turns into the state `closedByVisitor`, by the operator - `closedByOperator`.
 When both the visitor and the operator close the chat, it's state changes to the initial â `closed`. A chat can also automatically turn into the initial state during long-term absence of activity in it.
 Furthermore, the first message can be sent not only by a visitor but also by an operator. In this case the state will change from the initial to `invitation`, and then, after the first message of the visitor, it changes to `chatting`.
